        <p>Hello, my name is Michael Singleton and I am 3D artist that has been making 3D models for the past couple years in Blender.</p>
        <p>I have also been learning to do video editing in a software called "Davinci Resolve", a free video editing software for people to use for making content with it. If they would like to get more out of the software with some of the features, then they will have to purchase the full software on their website.</p>
        <p>To show how well my skills are in Davinci Resolve, I have video to show special FXs of some 3D models that was commissioned to me. Those who comissioned me wanted the FXs in a hologram like effect. Click the next button to see the next model.</p>
